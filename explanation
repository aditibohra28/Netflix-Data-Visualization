FIRST VISUALISATION (MAP)
- Symbol maps in Tableau display data points as symbols on a map, with each symbol representing a specific location or data point. Symbol maps are effective for 
visualizing geographical data and patterns, enhancing data analysis and insights.
- So, first we visualized the most preferred category of NETFLIX shows created by each country using Symbol map. 
- And observed that india used to release 2000+ TV thriller shows maximum.

SECOND VISUALISATION (GRAPH)
- A line graph in Tableau displays data points connected by lines, illustrating trends and patterns over time or across categories. It's effective for visualizing 
continuous data and identifying changes or relationships in the dataset.
- Next we've visualised the total no.of NETFLIX SHOWS released per year using line graph. It represents when the NETFLIX actually started 
booming i.e. 2014-2016.

THIRD VISUALISATION (GRAPH)
- In Tableau, a vertical bar graph represents data with vertical bars where the length of each bar corresponds to the value of a specific measure, facilitating 
easy comparison among categories or groups within a dataset.
- In next graph we get to see the comparison of rating corresponding to the count of NETFLIX Shows. And we noticed 
that max no.of shows fall in adult category. This is the major reason behind why netflix has a kids option in NETFLIX.
